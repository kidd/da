* Overview
  After hours of thinking about development environments and how we
  did it for Gojira, Pongo, and MBA, I wanted to create something that
  would be more generic and more powerful, but realised that the use
  cases depend a lot on the particular problem at hand.

  The most distilled version I'm using nowadays is the one with less
  complex dependencies and conditions, (not many optional services
  without any wiring), and also less complex requirements (no need to
  run tests on it, or run multiple instances in different networks)

  This repo is just an overriding docker-compose with couple of shell
  functions and an ad-hoc configuration file for the postgres docker
  container.

* Usage

  #+begin_src
    hma up [maildev db]
    hma down
    hma do [service] [$DA_CLI]
    hma do db
    hma do db bash
  #+end_src

* Install
